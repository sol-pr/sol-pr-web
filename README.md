## 📌 About The Project

Sol-PR is a web application that allows developers to earn bounties in Sol tokens by contributing to open-source projects. It is built using Next.js and leverages the Solana blockchain for secure and transparent transactions. Repo owners can attract new contributors while developers get rewarded for both feature additions and bug fixes.
